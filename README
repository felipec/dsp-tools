= dsp-tools =

Miscellaneous utilities for TI's C64x+ DSP.

 * dsp-test: runs simple trivial tests
 * dsp-load: prints the DSP CPU load and frequency
 * dsp-probe: checks running tasks
 * dsp-exec: loads base images into the DSP

== building ==

There are no dependencies, so just type 'make'. If you are using an old version
of TI's dspbrdige driver, do 'make DSP_API=0'.

== tidsp ==

You'll need a kernel with tidspbridge driver, the DSP firmware in /lib/dsp, and
the DSP running a proper baseimage (baseimage.dof).
